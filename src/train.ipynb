    "# 🎯 Enhanced Crash Forecast Attention Visualization Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 🧠 Goal:\n",
    "# Help users understand **which video frames your model focused on** when predicting a crash,\n",
    "# with **quantitative metrics** showing contribution percentages and confidence levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## ✅ Enhanced Step-by-Step Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step 1: Load Preprocessed Video Clip\n",
    "# - Load the `.npy` file (each one is a 16-frame video clip).\n",
    "# - This is the same clip used during model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step 2: Run Model to Predict Crash\n",
    "# - Send the clip into your trained VideoMAE model.\n",
    "# - Get the prediction (e.g., \"Crash likely\").\n",
    "# - **NEW**: Calculate confidence score from model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step 3: Capture Attention Map from Inside the Model\n",
    "# - Modify your model to save its **self-attention weights** during inference.\n",
    "# - Save this as `model.saved_attention`.\n",
    "# - The attention map shape will be: `[1, 12, 3136, 3136]`\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step 4: Convert Attention → Frame Importance with Metrics\n",
    "# - Each frame has 196 patches (14x14 grid).\n",
    "# - Group those patches by frame.\n",
    "# - Measure how much attention the model gave to each frame's patches.\n",
    "# - **NEW**: Calculate frame contribution percentages.\n",
    "# - **NEW**: Calculate overall confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Step 5: Enhanced Display in Streamlit\n",
    "# - For each frame:\n",
    "#   - Show the frame as an image\n",
    "#   - Show: \"Frame X contributed 23% to crash prediction\"\n",
    "#   - Show: \"Overall confidence: 87% that this is a crash scenario\"\n",
    "#   - Show: \"Attention score: 0.156 (high attention)\"\n",
    "# - Sort by attention score to show most-important frames first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 🚀 Enhanced Result\n",
    "# An interactive Streamlit dashboard that shows:\n",
    "# - What your model predicted\n",
    "# - What frames it paid attention to (and how much)\n",
    "# - **NEW**: Quantitative contribution percentages\n",
    "# - **NEW**: Confidence scores with explanations\n",
    "# - Why it made that decision (visually + numerically)\n",

    "#     return f\"Frame {frame_idx} contributed {frame_contribution:.1f}% to crash prediction\"\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Confidence Score:\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# def calculate_confidence(model_output):\n",
    "#     \"\"\"Calculate confidence from model's raw output\"\"\"\n",
    "#     # For regression: confidence based on how far from decision boundary\n",
    "#     # For classification: softmax probabilities\n",
    "#     confidence = abs(model_output - 0.5) * 2 * 100  # Convert to percentage\n",
    "#     return f\"Confidence: {confidence:.1f}% that this is a crash scenario\"\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Attention Score:\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# def calculate_attention_score(frame_attention):\n",
    "#     \"\"\"Calculate normalized attention score for this frame\"\"\"\n",
    "#     normalized_score = frame_attention / frame_attention.max()\n",
    "#     return f\"Attention score: {normalized_score:.3f} (high attention)\" if normalized_score > 0.5 else f\"Attention score: {normalized_score:.3f} (low attention)\"\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 🎁 Bonus Enhancements\n",
    "# - Helps explain the model's reasoning with numbers\n",
    "# - Makes your AV crash forecast project interview-ready\n",
    "# - Shows you're not just running models — you're quantifying their decisions\n",
    "# - Provides actionable insights for model improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let me know when you're ready to implement these quantitative metrics!"
